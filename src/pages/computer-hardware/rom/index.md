## Read Only Memory

ROM stands for read-only memory. It is a non-volatile memory that will retain its contents even after it has been powered off. Data written onto a strict ROM chip cannot be modified. More recent ROM types allow for some degree of modification, only at low speeds and for a limited number of times. In personal computers, ROM is used to store critical programs such as <a href='https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/firmware.htm' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>firmware</a>, responsible for booting and operating the device. ROM are found in a wide variety of devices from calculators to home video game console cartridges.
